DESIGN,todo ugly
DESIGN,todo quite sure full implications this!
DESIGN,works collection entries kept sequenced map persistence context maybe like entities keep separate sequences set todo calling entryset identitymap slow!!
DESIGN,todo id much rather done endloadingcollectioncollectionpersisterloadingcollectionentry
DESIGN,todo hack!!! note cleanup load context local lce entries works time really collection load contexts implemented long term cleanup become part close result set processing sandboxjdbc jdbccontainer code
DESIGN,todo add notion enabled filters cachekey differentiate filtered collections nonfiltered cachekey currently used collections entities would ideally need define two seperate ones currently works conjuction check defaultinitializecollectioneventhandlerinitializecollectionfromcache makes sure read cache enabled filters early exit!!!!!
DESIGN,postload needed ejb todo reuse postloadevent
DESIGN,todo check current isolation mode explicitly?
DESIGN,brand new collection todo array!! cant lock objects arrays now??
DESIGN,todo iteratively get transient entities retry merge one following conditions transientcopycachesize transientcopycachesize decreasing copycachesize increasing todo find retrying add entities copycache dont think retry throw transientobjectexception still transient entities
DESIGN,null brand new collection also inefficiently handle arrays snapshot cant better
DESIGN,todo perhaps additionally require incoming entity version equivalent defined unsavedvalue?
DESIGN,provides query splitting methods originally querytranslator br todo need refactored point author josh
DESIGN,todo taken verbatim dotnode either delegate logic supertype
DESIGN,todo currently expects individual expressions apply sql table join may case joinedsubclass property values might coming different tables joined hierarchy point expand support capability however difficulties biggest handle ors individual comparisons linked different sql joins would need track comparison individually along join alias applies pass information back fromelement pass along joinsequence
DESIGN,explicit select expression render id properties projection lists every persister clause single token node todo reason need stuff collection filters get rid derived select clause completely!
DESIGN,todo better way?!?
DESIGN,hack alert !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! attempt work around ghost impliedfromelements occasionally show actual things joined consistently occurs index nodes least manytomany sure conditions essentially lookahead next fromelement actually writes something sql
DESIGN,possible simply reuse versionpropertynode causes oom errors due circularity
DESIGN,function template restore output apply template write result todo downcast avoid using interface? yuck
DESIGN,point generate phase needs moved single objectlevel dml might spawn multiple sql dml command executions possible move sql generation dml stuff consistencysake probably best move responsiblity generation phase completely delegates queryloaderstatementexecutor also sure queryloader currently even dependency need it? ideally like see walker given delegates directly
DESIGN,todothis needed compilation eliminate instvar?
DESIGN,todo absolutely usages constructor form go away?
DESIGN,todo bit ugly?
DESIGN,even properties mapped base table referenced set clauses could handled basicdelegate todo decide better performancewise perform check simply use multitableupdatedelegate
DESIGN,todo remove last two batcher longer managing connections
DESIGN,important!!!! class needs free static references cglib javassist classes otherwise users always need classpaths matter either use another option would remove hibernateispropertyinitialized method users go sessionfactory get information
DESIGN,todo really need able deal component paths also difficult hqlsql grammar expects node types fromreferencenodes one potential fix would convert intoclause use fromclausefromelement combo child insertstatement move logic insertstatement thats probably easiest approach read least amount changes grammar code doesnt feel right insert would contain fromclauses
DESIGN,todo optimization would consider cascade deletes gen delete statements difficulty ordering tables vs cascade attributes persisters table info gotten really selfcontained ie class representation defining needed attributes could get array
DESIGN,todo switch statements always evil! already bugs forgotten token types use polymorphism this!
DESIGN,really two situations ok allow insertion properties defined superclass unionsubclass abstract root entity discrimsubclass handled already fact unionsubclasspersister alreay always returns call may want disallow discrimsubclass consistencysake currently work anyway
DESIGN,implicit joins always? ok reuse
DESIGN,todo used exprnoparens! needed?
DESIGN,todo may also want check types map exactly one columnjdbctype cant think situation arithmetic expression multicolumn mappings makes sense
DESIGN,know either type blind guess!
DESIGN,todo get sql rendering create ast join expressions use sql generator grammar generate sql text index expression
DESIGN,would probably refactor logicparser builds tree simple expressions connected expressionparser translates oo terms like foo foobar foobarbaz sql terms like foosid foosbar_id etc pathexpressionparser much thing
DESIGN,shortcircuit performance
DESIGN,absolutely necessary help aggressive release
DESIGN,try block hack around fact currently tuplizers given opportunity resolve subclass entity name allows assume custom interceptor ability influence decision able based given entityname
DESIGN,todo one ugliest fragile pieces code hibernate
DESIGN,todo implement functionality might painful join post processing subquery already performed meaning thetajoin dialects join conditions already moved clause simple solution might perform join post processing entire query including subqueries one fell swoop
DESIGN,yuck!
DESIGN,ignore incoming property could found cannot sure least safest simply apply dereference toggling
DESIGN,todo make bit nicer

DESIGN,todo reuse preloadevent
DESIGN,need better way define suffixes
DESIGN,workaround weblogic
DESIGN,todo temporary
DESIGN,todo yuck!!! fix hhh complete
DESIGN,would great move another method could also used new scrolling stuff would need change way maxrow stuff handled ie behind interface could control breaking means know stop
DESIGN,todo ientityspan bit depends upon subclass implementation bad
DESIGN,messy complex stuff since createcriteria take aliased path path rooted creating criteria instance
DESIGN,todo add criteriaimplementor interface class depends directly upon criteriaimpl impl package

DESIGN,create index key columns??
DESIGN,ok?
DESIGN,init table instead earlier get quoted table name todo would better simply pass qualified table name instead splitting schemacatalogtable names
DESIGN,perhaps exception since ever used method?
DESIGN,note assumes something propertyselectfragment implemented subclass! tounqotedaliasstrings getdiscriminatorcolumnname tried remove unqoting missing aliases
DESIGN,put placeholder entries dont recurse back try save object question done onsave called? likewise done onupdate?

DESIGN,could refactor bit
DESIGN,note class essentially delegates methods parent setvariable indirection small could probably fold functionality back base namespace special case changed times id like leave abstraction
DESIGN,simplified settings little
DESIGN,check strict java use isjavaassignable instead
