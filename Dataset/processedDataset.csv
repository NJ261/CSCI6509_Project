REQUIREMENT,note starteam status new implies item local machine repository items show view starteam gui one would think would want perhaps checkin new items unfortunately sdk doesnt really work cant actually see anything status new check everything without worrying losing anything
REQUIREMENT,generated classes must added generic jar! buggy old jonas ??
REQUIREMENT,todo comment still relevant ?? fixme need use saxsource source transform plug entity resolver
REQUIREMENT,turned temporarily appears bug windows
REQUIREMENT,pattern holds string exhausted generate false positives live

DESIGN,xxx throw exception instead?
DESIGN,temporary figure better api
DESIGN,better way save context shouldnt delegate next backward compatibility
DESIGN,quick fix antjava use property initializing project
DESIGN,xxx use jcvs instead command line execution dont rely native cvs stuff around
DESIGN,two reasons mentioned api docs filelist dir directory impossible wouldnt get case io error occurred

DESIGN,provides query splitting methods originally querytranslator todo need refactored point josh
DESIGN,todo taken verbatim dotnode either delegate logic supertype
DESIGN,todo currently expects individual expressions apply sql table join may case joinedsubclass property values might coming different tables joined hierarchy point expand support capability however difficulties biggest handle ors individual comparisons linked different sql joins would need track comparison individually along join alias applies pass information back fromelement pass along joinsequence
DESIGN,explicit select expression render id properties projection lists every persister clause single token node todo reason need stuff collection filters get rid derived select clause completely!
DESIGN,todo better way?!?
DESIGN,hack alert !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! attempt work around ghost impliedfromelements occasionally show actual things joined consistently occurs index nodes sure conditions essentially lookahead next fromelement actually writes something sql
DESIGN,possible simply reuse versionpropertynode causes oom errors due circularity
DESIGN,function template restore output apply template write result todo downcast avoid using interface? yuck

DESIGN,important!!!! class needs free static references method users go sessionfactory get information
DESIGN,todo really need able deal component paths also difficult hqlsql grammar expects node types fromreferencenodes one potential fix would convert intoclause use fromclausefromelement combo move logic insertstatement thats probably easiest approach doesnt feel right insert would contain fromclauses
DESIGN,todo optimization would consider cascade deletes gen delete statements difficulty ordering tables vs cascade attributes persisters table info gotten really selfcontained could get array
DESIGN,todo switch statements always evil! already bugs forgotten token types use polymorphism this!
DESIGN,really two situations ok allow insertion properties defined superclass unionsubclass abstract root entity discrimsubclass handled already fact unionsubclasspersister alreay always returns call may want disallow discrimsubclass consistencysake
DESIGN,implicit joins always ok reuse
DESIGN,todo used exprnoparens! needed?
DESIGN,todo may also want check types map exactly one columnjdbctype cant think situation arithmetic expression multicolumn mappings makes sense
DESIGN,know either type blind guess!
DESIGN,todo get sql rendering create ast join expressions use sql generator grammar generate sql text index expression
DESIGN,would probably refactor logicparser expressionparser pathexpressionparser
DESIGN,shortcircuit performance
DESIGN,absolutely necessary help aggressive release
DESIGN,try block hack around fact currently tuplizers given opportunity resolve subclass entity name allows interceptor ability influence decision able based given entityname
DESIGN,todo one ugliest fragile pieces code hibernate
DESIGN,todo implement functionality might painful join post processing subquery already performed simple solution might perform join post processing entire query one fell swoop
DESIGN,yuck!
DESIGN,ignore incoming property could found cannot sure least safest simply apply dereference toggling
DESIGN,todo make bit nicer
DESIGN,yuck!
DESIGN,todo potentially look optimizing two arrays
DESIGN,note parameter unused
DESIGN,todo figure better way get elements proper tree structure destination manytomany add child origin
DESIGN,todo constructor form used constructor directly us go away?

DESIGN,per instance
DESIGN,use proxy mechanism cast bshthis correct interface?
DESIGN,redundant constructor
DESIGN,issues resolve classloader define class? bshclassloader define there? use reflection set nonbsh classloader one always create bsh classloader ?
DESIGN,could refactor bit
DESIGN,note class essentially delegates methods parent setvariable indirection small could probably fold functionality back base namespace special case changed times id like leave abstraction
DESIGN,simplified settings little
DESIGN,check strict java use isjavaassignable instead
